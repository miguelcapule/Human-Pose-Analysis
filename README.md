**Pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) that involves detecting and tracking the position and orientation of human body parts in images or videos.**

What is Human Pose Analysis/Estimation?

- Human pose estimation is a task in computer vision, where the model tries to identify the key points on the human body, like limbs and joints, which can help us determine the pose a person is in right now. With HPE models we can dynamically track those points through motion in real time.
